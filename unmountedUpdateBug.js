This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that attempts to modify the state or props asynchronously. The problem is that the component might have unmounted by the time the asynchronous operation completes, leading to a state update on an unmounted component.  This can manifest as a cryptic error message, or simply unexpected behavior.
